# this is how to link a new repo on GitHub to an existing, local repo

A-issue a git init in the source directory

1-add and commit all changes to the local repo
git add --all
git commit -m "<add your commit comment here>"

2-create your repository in github, do not create README or .gitignore

3-add the origin to the local repo
git remote add origin <repo url goes here>
git push -u origin master
git pull origin master

3.5-instructions to reflect new convention of using 'main' instead of 'master' as the primary branch
git remote add origin <repo url goes here>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main

# in case you are cloning a repo and want to point the remote to your own repo

A-git clone <repo url>

1-change remote origin
git remote set-url origin <your repo url>
git push -u origin master
git pull origin master
